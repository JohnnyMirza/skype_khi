Key Health Indicators (KHI) are Performance Counters with recommended thresholds aimed at revealing problems that can impact the user experience.

It is strongly recommended that you download the KHI pack from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46895 and read the KHI_Guide to explain the metrics and thresholds you should care about

These inputs were built to ingest data recommended by Microsoft for:
- Lync Server 2013
- Skype for Business Server 2015 
- Skype for Business 2019

Visualisations have not been built for this yet as I don't have access to an environment with this information at this point in time.

I am not a Lync/Skype SME so if you have recommendations for improvements or find issues please let me know. Additionally if you are willing to provide me with an export of the data so I can build some visualisations please let me know.

Cheers,

Matt
